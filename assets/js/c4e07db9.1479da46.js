Our API lets you embed the Safely Finance Checkout experience anywhere on your website.\\n\\nBelow you\'ll find everything you need to get started with Safely Finance.\\n\\nIf there are any questions, reach out to us [team@safelyfinance.co](team@safelyfinance.co).\\n\\n# Introduction\\n\\nWhether you\'re a large multi-community operation, or a single rental, integrating with Safely Finance is quick and easy. Our docs provide the guidance your team needs to add Safely Finance to your tenant experience.\\n\\n# What is Safely Finance?\\n\\nSafely Finance lets you offer your tenants modern payment options for moving and renting. If they want to pay with the convenience of Apple or Google Pay, or pay over time, Safely Finance has you covered.\\n\\nWe believe the ultimate amenity is cash in your pocket. Your tenants want payment options because moving is stressful. With Safely Finance, you can give tenants options that make move-in costs flexible and convenient.\\n\\n# Data Types\\n\\nWhere applicable, the Safely Finance API uses a variety of standards for representing common pieces of data. More information can be found on each of these below.\\n\\n## Dates & Times\\n\\nAll dates are strings in the <a href=\\"https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html\\" target=\\"_blank\\">ISO 8601</a> format. The date representation is `YYYY-MM-DD` (for example, January 22, 2023 is represented as `2023-01-22`). All datetimes are stored and returned in UTC (for example `2023-01-22T14:40:00Z`).\\n\\n## Identifiers (IDs)\\n\\nAll IDs are strings represented by a Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID). The identifiers will follow a standard format (including hyphens) (for example `fa2facc6-31a8-44e7-bac3-719fac7062ee`). \\n\\n## Phone Numbers\\n\\nAll phone numbers are strings that follow the E.164 standard for international phone number formatting. The format is as follows,\\n```\\n[+][country code][area code][local phone number]\\n```\\n\\nAs an example, the US number (415) 555-0145 should be sent as the string `+14155550145`\\n\\n \\n# Embedded Flow\\n\\nThe Safely Finance embedded flow lets you implement alternative payment options for your prospective and current tenants within your existing website. The flow is initiated when a call is made to the Safely Finance API initiating a Move.\\n\\n1. A prospective tenant selects a floor plan\\n2. The tenant initiates the application process on the property website\\n3. A server-side call is made to the Safely Finance API to initiate a [Move](#operation/create-move) on the platform, a Move token is returned\\n4. On the property website, alternative payment options are shown to the tenant\\n5. When pay over time is selected, the Safely Finance checkout flow is loaded via pop-up\\n6. The tenant completes their account sign up (or sign in) with Safely Finance\\n7. An instantaneous check is performed for eligible offers\\n8. The tenant receives their loan terms and completes selection of a plan\\n8. The applicant is returned to the property website to complete their rental application\\n\\n\\n# Idempotent Requests\\n\\nThe Safely Finance API supports the use of an `idempotency_key`. This key is used for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice.\\n\\nAll `POST` requests accept idempotency keys.\\n\\n# Rate Limiting\\n\\nThe Safely Finance API limits the number of requests that can be received within a second. Limits are imposed to prevent abuse.\\n\\nCertain high-traffic applications may qualify for an increase to rate limits. Please [contact support](mailto:support@safelyfinance.co) to request an increase.\\n\\n# Response Codes\\n\\nThe Safely Finance API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of API requests.\\n\\nTypically, codes that are in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes that fall within the `4xx` range indicate an error contain a message body with a description of the error.\\n\\nAn example of an error response,\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\"status_code\\": 400,\\n  \\"message\\": \\"The request body was missing required parameters\\",\\n  \\"code\\": \\"missing-params\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n# Security\\n\\n## Authentication\\n\\nThe Safely Finance API uses token authentication (also known as bearer authentication).\\n\\nConsumers of the API can request a private token that can be used to make API requests. The token must be sent in the `Authorization` header when making all requests.\\n\\nFailure to pass a token with your request, or providing an invalid token, will result in a `401 Unauthorized` response following the format described in [Response Codes](#section/Response-Codes).\\n\\nExample Request\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl https://api.safelyfinance.co/hello \\\\\\n  -X GET \\\\\\n  -H \\"Authorization: Bearer sf_live_fkAk32AAFklj43KJKfk\\" \\\\\\n  -H \\"Content-Type: application/json\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Headers\\n\\nAny clients interfacing with the Safely Finance API must send the appropriate request headers.\\n\\n#### Content-Type\\n\\nAll requests that have a request body (typically `POST` and `PUT`) must also pass a content-type header of `application/json`.\\n\\n#### Accept\\n\\nAll requests must accept `application/json`, the standard response format for the Safely Finance API.\\n\\n## HTTPS\\n\\nThe Safely Finance API requires all communications to be secured using TLS 1.2 or greater.\\n"},"servers":[{"url":"https://api.safelyfinance.co/api/v1"}],"tags":[{"name":"community","x-displayName":"Community","description":"A community represents a single address where one or more rentals are available.
